The Weather App is a Python-based application developed to fetch and display real-time weather information for any city entered by the user. The main objective of this project is to provide a simple, interactive, and functional tool that demonstrates the use of API integration using Python.

This application uses the WeatherAPI service to retrieve live weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions. The app features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to view weather details in a clean and organized format.

The project focuses on:

Implementing API calls using the requests library

Handling JSON responses

Building a user-friendly GUI

Displaying real-time data dynamically

Understanding basics of API-based application development

This project serves as a beginner-friendly example of how Python can be used to build practical applications that interact with external services.
